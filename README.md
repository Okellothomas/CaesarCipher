## Description

In the art of work and the cyber world, information security is key, in order to navigate enemy's listening ears and the ears of potential cyber attacker, coding and encoding messages is crucial. This system use largely used by Agustin Ceacer, and this application implement it using Java.

This Java desktop application is documented and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it.

- When a runs the program at App.java they are prompted to either encode or decode. 
- If they choose to decode, they are prompted to enter the word they want to encode. and the corresponding encryption key. 
- Once they provide these info, there are provided with the encrypted word, the same applies for decryption. 
- If they enter any entry which is not 1 or 2, they are notified there are only two option.
